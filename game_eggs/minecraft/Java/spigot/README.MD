This is not a fork of Spigot.
Our version of paper includes preconfigured files to make it as optimized as possible.

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |
